## What Is XML?
 - XML (eXtensible Markup Language ) is a metalanguage (a language used to describe other languages) for defining vocabularies (custom markup languages), which is the key to XMLâ€™s importance and popularity. XML-based vocabularies (such as XHTML) let you describe documents in a meaningful way.
